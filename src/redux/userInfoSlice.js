// The function below is called a thunk and allows us to perform async logic. It

// code can then be executed and other actions can be dispatched

//   setTimeout(() => {
//     dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount));

// the state. Selectors can also be defined inline where they're used instead of
// in the slice file. For example: `useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)`
