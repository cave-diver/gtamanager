# GTA V Business Manager

The Business Manager is a web application which helps keep track of your in-game business supply and stock
levels in GTA Online. It simulates the businesses and notifies you when one needs your attention.

## Getting Started

### Using the Business Manager

To begin, click the cog of a business tab to set it up. Product and supply bars can be set by dragging the
bars to their in game values. Then, whenever you are in a session where businesses run (such as free roam
and contact missions), start the manager using the button near the map. Pause it when you are no longer in a
session. Your information will persist between browsing sessions.

### Installing as a PWA

You can install the Business Manager through browsers that support Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) for
a more native application experience. Currently, most mobile browsers support PWAs, as well as some
Chromium-based desktop browsers. The option to do this is generally found in your browser's dropdown menu.
